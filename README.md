# Mahalanobis_Distance

Mahalanobis distance is a measure of the distance between a point and a distribution, taking into account the covariance structure of the data.
It is often used in statistics and machine learning for outlier detection or clustering analysis. In this case, this script will use that method to compare an image with 5 models.
The input is an image which the user selected with a tkinter window and the output is a score and a possible match. After selecting the image with the tkinter image just let the code do its magic.
